# The CABC ontology: Chinese Ancient Book Catalog Ontology

The CABC ontology aims to formally represent the concepts present in Chinese ancient book catalogs (CABCs). 
By drawing on academic tradition and research needs in this area, the CABC ontology offers a reference conceptual model and opens new avenues for comprehending Chinese ancient books, thereby expanding the application scope of traditional Chinese ancient book catalogs.

The ontology consists of 34 classes, with top-level classes including Work, Edition, Item, Classification, Seal, Agent, Time, and Place. These classes are constructed based on a conceptual framework that draws on domain knowledge of cataloging and classical philology and uses terminology primarily sourced from The National Rare Ancient Book Directory (《国家珍贵古籍名录》).  The CABC ontology encompasses six types of information in CABCs, including responsible behaviors of agents involved in book creation, edition details, content classification, physical layout characteristics, contextual information, and collection institutions. By identifying essential concepts related to Chinese ancient books and adopting the general document understanding provided by FRBR and BIBFRAME, the CABC ontology aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of a Chinese ancient book in its various states, including as a creative work, an expression, and an accessible item.  Moreover, the CABC ontology utilizes objective properties to link the subclasses of Ancient Book (Work, Edition, Item) to other classes, thereby leading to a semantic description of CABC.
